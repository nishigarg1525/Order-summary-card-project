# Order-summary-card-project

## Description
This project is a simple and visually appealing order summary card UI. It features an image, order details, a pricing section, and action buttons for user interaction. The design is clean, responsive, and suitable for modern web applications.

## Features
- Responsive card layout.
- Smooth rounded corners and elegant box shadows.
- Interactive hover effects on buttons.
- Mobile-friendly design.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3 (including Flexbox and box shadows)

## How to Use
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Place the required images (`music1.avif` and `music-icon.webp`) in the same directory as `index.html`.
3. Open the `index.html` file in a browser to view the Order Summary Card.

## File Structure
```
project-folder/
│-- index.html  # Main HTML file
│-- music1.avif  # Header image
│-- music-icon.webp  # Icon image
│-- README.md   # Project documentation
```

## How It Works
- The `.container` class centers the card in the viewport.
- The `.box` class styles the card with padding, border-radius, and a flexbox layout.
- The `.box3` section displays the order details with an icon and pricing.
- The button uses a hover effect to scale up when hovered over.
- The "change" link allows modification of the selected plan.

## Customization
- Replace `music1.avif` and `music-icon.webp` with your own images.
- Modify the text inside the `<h2>`, `<p>`, and button elements to match your project.
- Adjust the CSS styles for different colors, fonts, or sizes.
